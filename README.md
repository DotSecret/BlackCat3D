About BlackCat3D

Mimic Shhans, a mysterious black cat with a passion for imitating human culture, has taken the world by storm and brought a feast of Asian aesthetics to the world. Mimic Shhans follows the CC0 agreement and its copyright has been dedicated to the public domain so that anyone can use it for personal or commercial use free of charge.

Encouraged by Shhan, the lead designer of Mimic Shhans, we started a second creation of the 3D version, inspired by a group of cat lovers who wanted to have their own black cat doll and bring the black cat from Web3 to real life. All the designs of BLACK CAT 3D are modelled in 3D.

BLACK CAT 3D was created to boost the activity of the Mimic Shhans community and to follow Shhan's desire to spread the influence of the IP. We will give all 2D holders the opportunity to Freemint and will create trendy products to make Mimic Shhans appear in more places.
